nY-Station
==========

nY-Station is an interactive installation that allows users to interact with and manipulate sonic data collected from various locations around New York City by the Citygram project. Users are invited to wear surveillance style headphones and manipulate sonic data through an eight-step sequencer, knobs and patch cables, casting the user in the role of a detached outside observer seeking to glean information from an array of possible connections and non-explicit meanings. While interaction with the installation will be interesting and rewarding for all users, only a small number will be able to decode the message.
